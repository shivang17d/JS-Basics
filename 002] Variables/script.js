/*
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.
Variable is a container to store data.
The value of a Javascript variable can be changed 
during the execution of the program.


Note : JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

1)Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
2)Names can begin with a letter, $ or _ 
3)Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables) (Shiv and shIv are diff)
4)Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

let a = 50
console.log(a)

a = "Shivang"
console.log(a)

// a --> identifier
// 50 , "Shivang"  --> literals
// =  ---> assignment operator.


// let 7shiv = 23  //Not allowed

let $abc = 55
let _asd = 23
console.log($abc,_asd)


// Note : JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
let Shiv = 50
let shiv = "gupta"
console.log(Shiv,shiv)
